## Tic-Tac-Toe

### Description
Two versions of Tic Tac Toe created in Python.  
*TicTacToe.py* will run a simple version of the game in the terminal, displaying the  
board and having the players take their moves by entering the number of the position  
from the keyboard.  
*TicTacToeGUI.py* was created using the *tkinter* package from the Python standard library.  
This creates a GUI for the game, displaying an interactive board where players can take their  
moves by clicking the position on the screen.
